## 🧬 What is ClinSight AI?

**ClinSight AI** is an **agentic clinical intelligence platform** that eliminates one of the most costly inefficiencies in modern hospitals:

> *Doctors walking into consultations without structured patient context.*

In busy hospital environments, a physician may manage hundreds of patients daily — each with dense, fragmented histories buried across case sheets, visit logs, lab reports, and prescription records. ClinSight deploys a **multi-agent AI pipeline** that automatically analyzes patient history, detects clinical risks, and generates a **60-second clinical brief** before the doctor even begins.

This isn't another AI chatbot. It's an **orchestrated clinical intelligence layer** — purpose-built for healthcare.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In busy clinical environments, doctors routinely manage hundreds of patients — each with dense, unstructured medical histories buried in case sheets, visit logs, and diagnostic reports.

| Pain Point | Reality |
|---|---|
| ⏱️ **Time-consuming** | Manually scrolling through records wastes critical minutes during consultations |
| 🔍 **Keyword-limited** | Traditional search misses semantic context — "fatigue" won't surface "chronic tiredness" |
| 🧩 **Fragmented** | Patient data is scattered across diagnoses, prescriptions, lab reports, and visit notes |
| ⚠️ **Error-prone** | Cognitive overload leads to missed drug interactions and overlooked patterns |
| 🔒 **Unaudited** | No traceable log of who accessed what clinical insight, when, and why |

> **There is no intelligent layer between the doctor and the data. ClinSight is that layer.**

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**ClinSight AI** bridges this gap by deploying a **multi-agent AI infrastructure** over patient medical records. Doctors query the system in plain English — by name, disease, or symptom — and receive a fully structured clinical brief in under 60 seconds.

The platform uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: patient records are embedded as semantic vectors, stored in a FAISS index, and retrieved via similarity search. A pipeline of **7 specialized agents** then handles analysis, triage, OCR ingestion, drug interaction detection, second-opinion generation, and more — all grounded in real patient data.

---

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

ClinSight deploys **7 specialized AI agents**, each owning a distinct part of the clinical intelligence pipeline:

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Retrieval Agent** | Semantic search across patient records using FAISS vector similarity |
| 📊 **Analysis Agent** | Structures raw patient data into coherent clinical profiles |
| ⚠️ **Triage Agent** | Detects high-risk conditions and flags critical patients automatically |
| 💊 **Drug Interaction Agent** | Cross-references prescriptions for dangerous drug combinations |
| 🧪 **Lab Trend Agent** | Analyzes lab value trajectories and surfaces anomalies over time |
| 🔬 **Second Opinion Agent** | Generates evidence-backed differential diagnoses with confidence scores |
| 📄 **OCR Ingestion Agent** | Parses scanned PDF case sheets into structured patient records |

## ⚡ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10** or higher
- `git` installed
- Your JSON medical dataset file

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyashgautam/clinsight-ai.git
cd clinsight-ai
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your Dataset

```
clinsight-ai/
└── data/
    ├── patients.json        ← structured patient records
    └── case_sheets/         ← scanned PDFs (optional, for OCR agent)
```

> 📌 See `data/sample_patients.json` for the expected record schema.

### 5. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to set your dataset path, blockchain node config, and any custom values.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app launches at **`http://localhost:8501`** in your browser.

**On first launch:**
1. The system automatically **ingests and indexes** all patient records from your dataset
2. The OCR agent processes any PDF case sheets in `data/case_sheets/`
3. Embeddings are generated once and **cached** for subsequent runs
4. The full 7-agent search interface is ready as soon as indexing completes

---

```
👤 Patient Name Search
→ "Arjun Sharma"
→ "Priya Mehta"

Returns: 60-second dashboard — profile, diagnosis, medications,
         drug interaction alerts, lab trends, second opinion.

🦠 Disease / Condition Search
